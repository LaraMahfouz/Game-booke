                        <p class="par"> Clefable is tall, pink Pokémon with a vaguely star-shaped body. It has long,
                            pointed ears with dark brown tips and black, oval eyes with wrinkles on either side. A
                            curled lock of fur hangs over its forehead, much like its long, tightly curled tail. On its
                            back is a pair of dark pink wings; each wing has three points. Its hands have three fingers
                            each, and its feet have two clawed toes and dark pink soles.

                            Clefable is a timid creature that flees when it senses people approaching and is one of the
                            world's rarest Pokémon. Its sensitive ears can distinctly hear a pin drop from half a mile
                            (one kilometer) away. Because of its acute hearing, it prefers to live in quiet, mountainous
                            areas of which it is protective. Using a bouncy gait, it is able to walk on water and
                            sometimes appears to be flying using its small wings. The anime has shown that Clefable is
                            actually an extraterrestrial Pokémon.</p>
